Step 1:
"Try cleaning the local .m2/repository/ folder manually using rm -rf and then re build the project. Worked for me after trying every possible other alternative(reinstalling eclipse, pointing to the correct maven version in eclipse, proxy settings etc)"

Steo 2:
"Mainly this occurs during Eclipse upgrade. 
I Solved using:

-> Right Click Project-> Maven->Update Project-> Select all (checkbox)

Old or out-dated, projects got refreshed with the updated jar files, and the required plugins. No more errors were visible."
